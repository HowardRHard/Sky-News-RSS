# Sky News RSS Test
*By Howard Hardy*

## Task Description:

Design a simple Android app that takes data from one of the Sky News rss feeds linked here
https://news.sky.com/info/rss and display it as a list on a single page. Each item in the
list should contain: a title, a description, a link to the news article (which opens in a browser
when clicked on), the image from the article

## Future Development

If I had more time I would have invested it into the design of the application, making it look more
friendly on the eyes. Had there been more complexity to the task, I would have added some testing in
the form of Unit tests(using the JUnit framework) and possibly some UI tests (using Espresso). If there
was some more complexity to this task, I would have loved to show off my knowledge of: Retrofit/OkHttp,
Room, Jetpack Navigation, Hilt and a more comprehensive showcasing of Coroutines and app architecture.
I would have likely also enabled the changing of the news feed (via an icon the TopAppBar), or even 
changing the news source from Sky to BBC (this would probably involve a home page, which would navigate
to the current composable I have when you open the app). I also would have added a loading indicator and
made the errors I catch to be more comprehensive (Possibly having a 'try again' to reload button)
